# MangoDB

MangoDB is an open-source stateless proxy, which converts MongoDB wire protocol queries to SQL, and uses PostgreSQL as a database engine.
It will be compatible with MongoDB drivers and should work as a drop-in replacement for MongoDB in many cases.
See [this example](https://github.com/MangoDB-io/example) for a short demonstration.

MangoDB is in a very early stage and welcomes all contributors.
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
